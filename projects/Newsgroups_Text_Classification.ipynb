    "A.) Given the sparse nature of the data, we would have expected the poor f-1 score from KNN. Additionally, Since KNN's objective function is standard euclidean distance as the dimensions of the data increases KNN performance begins to drop off. For both of these reasons I would expect consistently poor performance from KNN given this data.\n",
    "\n",
    "B.) When considering the relative performance of our Logistic Regression and our Multinomial Naive Bayes model we must first consider our data set and associated labels. What we are trying to predict is one of four classes. As we know, Logistic Regression performs best when the dependent variable is binary (i.e. Spam vs Ham). Since this isn't the case with the problem at hand (classifying 0, 1, 2 and 3), we would expect the Multinomial Naive Bayes to outperform the logistic regression despite the large number of features in the data set working against Naive Bayes' fundamental assumption of indepenence amongst input variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "C.) First, we know that C is the inverse of regularization strength. So, a lower C value indicates more smoothing. Regularization penalizes increasing the weight or magnitude of your parameters. At lower values of C, there is more regularization and therefore the sum of squared weights should reduce in value. At higher values of C, there is less regularization and therefore the sum of squared weights should increase in value. Given that we have a lot of parameters its likely that we are overfitting our model to idiosyncracies in our training data. Ultimately this should help to make our model more generalizable."

    "(5) Try to improve the logistic regression classifier by passing a custom preprocessor to CountVectorizer. The preprocessing function runs on the raw text, before it is split into words by the tokenizer. Your preprocessor should try to normalize the input in various ways to improve generalization. For example, try lowercasing everything, replacing sequences of numbers with a single token, removing various other non-letter characters, and shortening long words. If you're not already familiar with regular expressions for manipulating strings, see https://docs.python.org/2/library/re.html, and re.sub() in particular. With your new preprocessor, how much did you reduce the size of the dictionary?\n"

    "(6) The idea of regularization is to avoid learning very large weights (which are likely to fit the training data, but not generalize well) by adding a penalty to the total size of the learned weights. That is, logistic regression seeks the set of weights that minimizes errors in the training data AND has a small size. The default regularization, L2, computes this size as the sum of the squared weights (see P3, above). L1 regularization computes this size as the sum of the absolute values of the weights. The result is that whereas L2 regularization makes all the weights relatively small, L1 regularization drives lots of the weights to 0, effectively removing unimportant features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Train a logistic regression model using a \"l1\" penalty. Output the number of learned weights that are not equal to zero. How does this compare to the number of non-zero weights you get with \"l2\"? Now, reduce the size of the vocabulary by keeping only those features that have at least one non-zero weight and retrain a model using \"l2\".\n",
